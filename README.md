# Make-a-Difference

This is a simple website that is being developed as an introduction to web design and web programming for a web development (very appropriately named) class.

### Requirements

* A navbar for buttons that redirect to the separate sub-pages of the site.
* Large splash image on the main page of the website to attract user attention.
* Simplistic UI design to make it easy for new users to maneuver the site.

More requirements later.

### Developers

Contributors and developers of the website get to keep the site design they helped to create, free of charge. No legal issues attached.
